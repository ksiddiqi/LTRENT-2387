Pre-requisites: Step 1: Traffic from SD-WAN sites Earlier tasks, that include integration of SD-WAN sites to Umbrella, configuraiton of Umbrella policies such as Firewall, Web etc. must be completed successfully as a pre-requisite to this task. The traffic monitored by Umbrella, as per those policies, will be viewed in this task. In this step, traffic must be initiated for Umbrella monitoring as per below steps: On the RDP session, use mRemoteNG application to logon the console of VM named Site300-Ubuntu-VPN10 . This VM exists on VPN #10 of this site. From the Chromium Web browser initiate traffic to facebook.com and cisco.com . As per earlier tasks, the traffic to facebook.com should be blocked by Umbrella on Site-300. On the mRemoteNG application launch the Terminal application in the RDP session of the Site300-Ubuntu-VPN10 . Then initiate ICMP traffic by issuing below ping command. After few seconds stop the ping by issuing Control-C . As per configuration in earlier task, this traffic should be blocked by Umbrella: ping 8.8.8.8 You may also issue ping 1.1.1. command to validate site connectivity to Internet via Umbrella is working properly. Stop the ping traffic by issuing Control-C . Next, * On the RDP session, use mRemoteNG application to logon the console of VM named Site400-Ubuntu-VPN10 . This VM exists on VPN #10 of this site. * From the Chromium Web browser initiate traffic to cnn.com and cisco.com . As per earlier task, the traffic to cnn.com should be blocked by Umbrella. Step 2 - Activity Reports for Web URLs The web and other IP traffic activity from the SD-WAN branch sites over a selected time period can be viewed from Activity Search on Cisco Umbrella. These reports can be filtered by various categories such as identity name, destination, source IP, etc. On the RDP session, access the Umbrella web page by clicking on Umbrella SSO short cut on Google Chrome browser. Go to Reporting > Core Reports and click on Activity Search : Here you can view the result of every DNS, URL, and IP request from your various SD-WAN sites and other identities. Browse through to view some of the past results. Click on Filter to close the filter tab and then click on Advanced button in the Search field. On the Advanced Search page, navigate to to the URL section and enter cnn.com . Then click Apply as shown in below screenshot: You will now see all the search results matching URL of cnn.com .
