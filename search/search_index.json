It discovers and protects sensitive data stored being exposed outside of an organization. This tasks will walk through the steps to create policy (called Real Time DLP Rule) that will monitor the web proxy traffic and then allow administrators to decide if the content should only be monitored or blocked. In this case policy to monitor, and then block, files for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) classification will be configured. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy. Files with personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers etc must be handled with care. A sample file will be used to test the compliance of GDPR regulation i.e., monitoring and then enforcing/blocking.

Further we will propagate default route from Site-100 towards Site-400 (& Site-300) on VPN-10. This default route will result in Site-400 (& Site-300) to use Site-100 as default gateway on VPN-10. Hence Site-400 will route internet traffic through Site-100 by sending traffic over the SD-WAN Fabric. Step 1 \u2013 Verify no internet access on VPN-10 of Site-400 and Site-300 On the RDP session, launch mRemoteNG application. This application is used to get Console access to all of the Ubuntu machines (Virtual Machines / hosts) that are located on the respective LANs (VPNs) of the SD-WAN sites. To login the console of VM named Site400-Ubuntu-VPN10 , click on it's name on mRemoteNG application under the VNC Sessions . As the name indicates, this VM exists on VPN-10 (LAN segment) of Site-400. The console of Ubuntu host/VM may be initially locked, click on the console and use below credentials to login to the Desktop of Ubuntu VM: Username: ubuntu Password: viptela Launch Chromium Web Browser on Desktop of this Ubuntu machine by clicking on it's icon as shown below: Try to access internet websites such as cisco.com .

Tip: Have a look at details of these packets by clicking on view Full Details and then review the Protocol field (ICMP, UDP)! Step 3 - Top Destinations Reports In this step we will view the traffic to most active destinations on Umbrella Dashboard. On Umbrella Dashboard, navgiate to Reporting > Additional Reports > Top Destinations . It will show the most visited destinations. In previous tasks, on Ubuntu Virtual Machines at the SD-WAN sites, you had browsed to various websites. As Ubuntu VM settings the DNS queries will be routed via DNS Resolver with IP address of 1.1.1.1 . Below Figure shows an example screenshot from a lab system. Note: Your screen may not have the same output. Click on 1.1.1.1 among the list of destinations as shown below: Once 1.1.1.1 is clicked it will show below screenshot. Click on VIEW 1.1.1.1 IN INVESTIGATE to view more details of this IP address as shown below The investigate page shows more details about this IP address as shown in below screenshot. Click on Talos to view the reputation and other intelligence from Cisco Talos about this IP address. Here is the screenshot from Cisco Talos about this IP address Optional Step 4 - additional reports If you have time then you can proceed to view various other reports on Umbrella Dashboard: Navigate to Reporting > Additional Request > Top Identities to view the traffic by various Identities. As expected, the Network tunnels (four) will be shown here. Allowed or Blocked Responses by specific Traffic type can also be viewed on this page by clicking under the Responses . You can vew the Tunnel and site with most traffic and the respective count (i.e. number of Requests ) in your lab pod on this page. Navigate to Reporting > Additional Request > Total Request to view Traffic by type ( Firewall , DNS , Web , All) and Responses ( Allowed , Blocked ). You can check for Allowed or Blocked by Traffic type can be viewed on this page by clicking under the Responses Navigate to Reporting > Additional Request > Top Categories to view the traffic by various categories such as Advertisements, Search Engines etc. Note traffic size and number of requests by various categories is shown in these reports.
